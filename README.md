### Data-Visualization Server

This project is integrated with <a href="https://github.com/arcta/server-setup">Data-Science R&amp;D on Ubuntu</a>

Intended usage:

* create visualization
* explore it using interactive settings
* bookmark insight
* share insight as deep-link or image

Standard toolbox comes with all types:
* zoom ( click on icon to enable, then click again to go back to tooltip )
* bookmark ( deep-link )
* render as image ( png )

With dynamic data source there's no bookmarking capability, but, a png snapshot can be taken and saved locally.
